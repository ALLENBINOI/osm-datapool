# OpenStreetMap Datapool

### ðŸŒŸ Introduction
As per wikipedia, [**OpenStreetMap**](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a collaborative project to create a free editable geographic database of the world. The geodata underlying the maps is considered the primary output of the project. It is a tool for creating and sharing map information. Anyone can contribute to OSM, and thousands of people add to the project every day.

OpenStreetMap is a good alternative to Google Maps. You might not get the same level of information as Google Maps. But for basic navigation and traveling, OpenStreetMap is sufficient. For a better understanding of the project, refer the below mentioned articles.
