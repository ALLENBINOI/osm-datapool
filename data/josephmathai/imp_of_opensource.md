# Importance of Open Source Contribution in A Students Life

Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine. When you find a bug in an open 
source software you use, you may want to look at the source to see if you can patch it yourself. If that’s the case, then contributing the patch back is the best 
way to ensure that your friends (and yourself when you update to the next release) will be able to benefit from it.By definition, all of your open source work is 
public, which means you get free examples to take anywhere as a demonstration of what you can do.

## Improve existing skills
Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing, if you’re looking for practice, there’s a task for you on an open source project. 
Open source offers opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organizing teams of people, and prioritizing work.

## Meet people who are interested in similar things
Open source projects with warm, welcoming communities keep people coming back for years. Many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in 
open source, whether it’s running into each other at conferences or late night online chats about burritos.

## Find mentors and teach others
Working with others on a shared project means you’ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. The acts of learning and teaching can 
be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved.
